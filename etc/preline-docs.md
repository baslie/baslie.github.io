## Tailwind CSS Card

Use pre-built Tailwind CSS cards with various layouts and interactive UI components. Ideal for product and event listings, user profiles, dashboards, and more.


---

### Basic usage


---

### Example

A basic card containing a title, content and an extra corner content.

Cards assume no specific width to start, so they'll be 100% wide unless otherwise stated.

---

### Images

Cards include a few options for working with images. Choose from appending “image caps” at either end of a card, overlaying images with card content, or simply embedding the image in a card.


---

### Image placeholders

Similar to headers and footers, cards can include top and bottom "image placeholder"—images at the top.

### Top bordered card

You can change the color of the border by using a different `border-color` utility class. For example, to change the border color to red, you would use the `border-red-500` utility class.

              You can also change the width of the border by using a different `border-width` utility class. For example, to make the border wider, you would use the `border-t-2` utility class.

The@tailwindcss/formsplugin does not natively support the indeterminate state for checkboxes. However, you can implement this functionality with custom CSS.


                        You can add custom styles for the indeterminate state in your `tailwind.config.js` file as shown below:


tailwind.config.js:

```javascript
module.exports = {
                      theme: {
                        extend: {
                          customForms: theme => ({
                            default: {
                              checkbox: {
                                '&:indeterminate': {
                                  background: 'url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox=\'0 0 16 16\' fill=\'white\' xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\'%3E%3Crect width=\'8\' height=\'2\' x=\'4\' y=\'7\' rx=\'1\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");',
                                  borderColor: 'transparent',
                                  backgroundColor: 'currentColor',
                                  backgroundSize: '100% 100%',
                                  backgroundPosition: 'center',
                                  backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat',
                                }
                              }
                            }
                          })
                        },
                      },
                      plugins: [
                        require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
                      ],
                    }

### Basic usage


---

### Adding based on column count


                Use the `columns-{count}` utilities to set the number of columns that should be created for the content within an element. The column width will be automatically adjusted to accommodate that number.



---

### Adding based on column width


                Use the `columns-{width}` utilities to set the ideal column width for the content within an element, with the number of columns (the count) automatically adjusting to accommodate that value.



                This "t-shirt" scale is the same as the max-width scale, with the addition of `2xs` and `3xs`, since smaller columns may be desirable.

### Setting the column gap

To specify the width between columns, you can use thegap-xutilities:

## Tailwind CSS Configuration

A guide to configuring and customizing the default Preline UI and Tailwind CSS options and styles.

Make sure that the Preline UI is successfully installed as a plugin in your Tailwind CSS. If you haven't done so, you get started with ourquick setup.

Make sure that the Preline UI is successfully installed as a plugin in your Tailwind CSS. If you haven't done so, you get started with ourquick setup.

### Configuration options


---

### Theme


                The `@theme` directive is where you define your color palette, fonts, type scale, border sizes, breakpoints — anything related to the visual design of your site.


```
@theme {
                    --color-blue: oklch(0.707 0.165 254.624);
                    --color-purple: oklch(0.714 0.203 305.504);
                    --color-pink: oklch(0.718 0.202 349.761);
                    --color-orange: oklch(0.75 0.183 55.934);
                    --color-green: oklch(0.792 0.209 151.711);
                    --color-yellow: oklch(0.852 0.199 91.936);
                    --color-gray-dark: oklch(0.13 0.028 261.692);
                    --color-gray: oklch(0.707 0.022 261.325);
                    --color-gray-light: oklch(0.985 0.002 247.839);

                    --font-serif: "Inter, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji";
                    --font-serif: "Merriweather", "serif";
                    --columns: 14;

                    --spacing-8xl: 96rem;
                    --spacing-9xl: 128rem;

                    --radius-4xl: 2rem;
                  }
```


---

### Plugins


                The `@plugins` directive allows you to register plugins.


```
@plugin "@tailwindcss/forms";
                  @plugin "@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio";
```


---

### Prefix


                The `prefix` option allows you to add a custom `prefix` to all of Preline UI and Tailwind's generated utility classes.



                For example, you could add a `hs` `prefix` by setting the `prefix` option like so:


```javascript
@import "tailwindcss" prefix(hs);
```

Now every class will be generated with the configured prefix:

```
.hs\:text-start {
                    text-align: left;
                  }

                  .hs\:text-center {
                    text-align: center;
                  }

                  .hs\:text-end {
                    text-align: right;
                  }

                  /* etc. */
```

---

### Basic usage


---

### Using the container


                The `container` class sets the `max-width` of an element to match the `min-width` of the current breakpoint. This is useful if you’d prefer to design for a fixed set of screen sizes instead of trying to accommodate a fully fluid viewport.


Note that unlike containers you might have used in other frameworks,Tailwind's container does not center itself automatically and does not have any built-in horizontal padding.


                To center a container, use the `mx-auto` utility:


```html
<div class="container mx-auto">
                    <!-- ... -->
                  </div>
```


                To add horizontal padding, use the `px-{size}` utilities:


```html
<div class="container mx-auto px-4">
                    <!-- ... -->
                  </div>
```

If you'd like to center your containers by default or include default horizontal padding, see thecustomization optionsbelow.


---

### Applying conditionally


---

### Responsive variants


                The `container` class also includes responsive variants like md:`container` by default that allow you to make something behave like a `container` at only a certain breakpoint and up:


```html
<!-- Full-width fluid until the `md` breakpoint, then lock to container -->
                  <div class="md:container md:mx-auto">
                    <!-- ... -->
                  </div>
```


---

### Customizing


---

### Centering by default


                To center containers by default, set the `margin-inline` CSS rule to `auto` in the `@utility container` directive of your config file:


```
@utility container {
                    margin-inline: auto;
                  }
```


---

### Adding horizontal padding


                To add horizontal padding by default, specify the amount of padding you’d like using the `padding-inline` CSS rule in the `@utility container` directive of your config file:


```
@utility container {
                    padding-inline: 2rem;
                  }
```


                If you want to specify a different padding amount for each breakpoint, use an object to provide a `default` value and any breakpoint-specific overrides:


```javascript
:root {
                    --container-padding: 1rem;
                  }

                  @media (min-width: var(--breakpoint-sm)) {
                    :root {
                      --container-padding: 2rem;
                    }
                  }

                  @media (min-width: var(--breakpoint-lg)) {
                    :root {
                      --container-padding: 4rem;
                    }
                  }

                  @media (min-width: var(--breakpoint-xl)) {
                    :root {
                      --container-padding: 5rem;
                    }
                  }

                  @media (min-width: var(--breakpoint-2xl)) {
                    :root {
                      --container-padding: 6rem;
                    }
                  }

                  @utility container {
                    padding-inline: var(--container-padding);
                  }
```

## Tailwind CSS Dark Mode

Style your site in dark mode with ready made Preline UI's dark mode toggle components.


---

#### Requires JS

Note that this component requires the use of ourTheme Switchplugin, else you can skip this message if you are already using Preline UI as a package.


---

### About

With dark mode becoming a first-class feature in many operating systems, it's increasingly common to design a dark version of your website alongside the default design. By integrating dark mode, you can meet user preferences and improve readability in low-light environments, ensuring your site is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.Tailwind and Preline UI make this easy by including a dark variant, allowing you to style your site differently when dark mode is enabled.

Tailwind and Preline UI make this easy by including a dark variant, allowing you to style your site differently when dark mode is enabled.


---

### Manual Set Up


---

### Toggling dark mode manually


                If you want your `dark` theme to be driven by a CSS selector instead of the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, override the `dark` variant to use your custom selector:


```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

                  @custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
```


                Now instead of ``dark`:*` utilities being applied based on `prefers-color-scheme`, they will be applied whenever the `dark` class is present earlier in the HTML tree:



                How you add the `dark` `class` to the `html` element is up to you, but a common approach is to use a bit of JavaScript that updates the `class` attribute and syncs that preference to somewhere like `localStorage`.

---

### Switcher options


---

### Switcher


                Use `data-hs-theme-switch` If you want to create a dark mode switcher for Tailwind CSS and Preline UI, you'll have to add some JavaScript code and a toggle element that a user can use to change their preferences.

## 💻 Примеры кода

### Installjqueryvia npm

```text
npm i jquery
```

### Installdatatables.net-dtvia npm

```text
npm i datatables.net-dt
```

### Add CSS for hiding some default elements:

```javascript
.dt-layout-row:has(.dt-search),
                        .dt-layout-row:has(.dt-length),
                        .dt-layout-row:has(.dt-paging) {
                          display: none !important;
                        }
```

### Include the JavaScript after initializing the Datatables:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
                          ...

                          const inputs = document.querySelectorAll('.dt-container thead input');

                          inputs.forEach((input) => {
                            input.addEventListener('keydown', function (evt) {
                              if ((evt.metaKey || evt.ctrlKey) && evt.key === 'a') this.select();
                            });
                          });
                        });
```

### This example shows how to filter a DataTable.

```javascript
(function () {
                          const minEl = document.querySelector('#hs-input-number-min-age');
                          const maxEl = document.querySelector('#hs-input-number-max-age');
                          const { dataTable } = new HSDataTable('#hs-datatable-filter');

                          dataTable.search.fixed('range', function (searchStr, data, index) {
                            const min = parseInt(minEl.value, 10);
                            const max = parseInt(maxEl.value, 10);
                            const age = parseFloat(data[2]) || 0;

                            if (
                              (isNaN(min) && isNaN(max)) ||
                              (isNaN(min) && age <= max) ||
                              (min <= age && isNaN(max)) ||
                              (min <= age && age <= max)
                            ) return true;

                            return false;
                          });

                          minEl.addEventListener('input', () => dataTable.draw());
                          maxEl.addEventListener('input', () => dataTable.draw());
                        })();
```

### This example shows how to filter a DataTable column.

```javascript

                          const addressEl = document.querySelector('#hs-input-text-column-address');

                          const { dataTable } = new HSDataTable('#hs-datatable-with-column-filter');

                          dataTable.search.fixed('range', function (searchStr, data, index) {
                            const person = personEl.value === 'all' ? '' : personEl.value;
                            const name = data[1] || '';

                            const min = parseInt(minEl.value, 10);
                            const max = parseInt(maxEl.value, 10);
                            const age = parseFloat(data[2]) || 0;

                            const address = addressEl.value.toLowerCase();
                            const city = data[3].toLowerCase() || '';

                          minEl.addEventListener('input', () => dataTable.draw());

### This example shows how to add "hidden column" functionality.

```javascript
(function () {
                          const { dataTable } = new HSDataTable('#hs-datatable-with-hidden-columns');
                          const select = HSSelect.getInstance('#hs-datatable-with-hidden-columns-select', true);

                          select.element.on('change', (indices) => {
                            dataTable.columns().every(function (index) {
                              const column = this;

                              if (indices.includes(index.toString())) column.visible(false);
                              else column.visible(true);
                            });
                          });
                        })();

### Transform style animation

We are using Floating UI library for dropdown and tooltip and this library uses hardcoded styles like transform for menu positioning. In this situation we can use  Tailwind translate classes for sub-container inside menu, also just add `data-hs-transition` attribute for the sub-container.

Layout


---

## Tailwind CSS Grid

Use the powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system and dozens of predefined classes.


---

### Grid Template Columns


---

### Specifying the columns in a grid


                Use the `grid-cols-{n}` utilities to create grids with n equally sized columns.


See theGrid Template Columnsfor a complete list of grid options.


---

### Grid Column Start / End


---

### Spanning Columns


                Use the `col-span-{n}` utilities to make an element span n columns.



---

### Starting and ending lines


                Use the `col-start-{n}` and `col-end-{n}` utilities to make an element start or end at the nth grid line. These can also be combined with the `col-span-{n}` utilities to span a specific number of columns.


Note that CSS grid lines start at 1, not 0, so a full-width element in a 6-column grid would start at line 1 and end at line 7.


---

### Equal width

Every column width same size example.

See theGrid Column Start / Endfor a complete list of grid options.


---

### Grid Template Rows


---

### Specifying the rows in a grid


                Use the `grid-rows-{n}` utilities to create grids with n equally sized rows.


See theGrid Template Rowsfor a complete list of grid options.


---

### Grid Row Start / End


---

### Spanning rows


                Use the `row-span-{n}` utilities to make an element span n rows.



---

### Grid Auto Flow


---

### Controlling grid element placement


                Use the `grid-flow-{keyword}` utilities to control how the auto-placement algorithm works for a grid layout.


See theGrid Auto Flowfor a complete list of grid options.


---

### Gap


---

### Setting the gap between elements


                Use `gap-{size}` to change the gap between both rows and columns in grid and flexbox layouts.



---

### Changing row and column gaps independently


                Use `gap-x-{size}` and `gap-y-{size}` to change the gap between rows and columns independently.


See theGapfor a complete list of grid options.

## Tailwind CSS Images

Documentation and examples for opting images into all kinds of behaviors.


---

### Images are block-level


                In Tailwind, images and other replaced elements (like `svg`, `video`, `canvas`, and others) are `display: block` by default.



                This helps to avoid unexpected alignment issues that you often run into using the browser default of `display: inline`.



                If you ever need to make one of these elements ``inline`` instead of `block`, simply use the ``inline`` utility:



---

### Image thumbnails

UseWidthandHeightutility classes to give an image fixed size.


---

### Background attachment


---

### Fixed


                Use `bg-fixed` to fix the background image relative to the viewport.

### Floating label

A placeholder is required on each ``<input>`` as our method uses the `:placeholder-shown` pseudo-element. Also note that the ``<input>`` must come first so we can utilize a sibling selector (e.g., `~`).

## Tailwind CSS Modal

The Modal component, often referred to as a Dialog or Popover, is a layer above the page that engages users with content requiring their interaction. It comes with a variety of features, including scrolling behavior, focus management, backdrop styles, multiple sizes, and more, ensuring an enhanced user experience.


---

#### Requires JS

Note that this component requires the use of ourOverlayplugin, else you can skip this message if you are already using Preline UI as a package.


---

### Basic usage


---

### Example

The default form of a modal dialog.

---

### Animations


---

### Scale animation

Experience the classic modal dialog with an engaging scale animation effect.

Apply the `hs-overlay-animation-target` class to observe the target element's animation. The plugin will then monitor all transitions of these elements until they're complete before hiding the popup.

---

### Scrolling behavior

Modal dialogs differ in width, whereas height is determined by the content. Once it reaches a certain threshold, the body content will scroll while the header and footer remain fixed until the bottom of the modal dialog is reached.

The scroll behavior of modals can be configured so that scrolling happens inside the modal body or outside the modal, within the viewport.

In either case, modals prevent the window from being scrolled both natively and programatically. This will prevent browser issues such as `scrollIntoView` scrolling the window instead of only the closest scroll parent.

#### Be bold

Motivate teams to do their best work. Offer best practices to get users going in the right direction. Be bold and offer just enough help to get the work started, and then get out of the way. Give accurate information so users can make educated decisions. Know your user's struggles and desired outcomes and give just enough information to let them get where they need to go.


---

#### Be optimistic

Focusing on the details gives people confidence in our products. Weave a consistent story across our fabric and be diligent about vocabulary across all messaging by being brand conscious across products to create a seamless flow across all the things. Let people know that they can jump in and start working expecting to find a dependable experience across all the things. Keep teams in the loop about what is happening by informing them of relevant features, products and opportunities for success. Be on the journey with them and highlight the key points that will help them the most - right now. Be in the moment by focusing attention on the important bits first.


---

#### Be practical, with a wink

Keep our own story short and give teams just enough to get moving. Get to the point and be direct. Be concise - we tell the story of how we can help, but we do it directly and with purpose. Be on the lookout for opportunities and be quick to offer a helping hand. At the same time realize that nobody likes a nosy neighbor. Give the user just enough to know that something awesome is around the corner and then get out of the way. Write clear, accurate, and concise text that makes interfaces more usable and consistent - and builds trust. We strive to write text that is understandable by anyone, anywhere, regardless of their culture or language so that everyone feels they are part of the team.

### Stacked Overlays

Stacked Overlays modals represent a design approach in user interfaces, where several overlay windows, known as modals, are layered on top of one another. This is commonly seen in web or mobile application interfaces.

#### Modal title (level 1)

Stacked Overlays modals are a user interface design concept where multiple overlay windows, or modals, are displayed on top of each other, typically in a web or app interface. These modals are often used to present additional information, confirm actions, or to guide users through multi-step processes. The key characteristic of Stacked Overlays is their layered appearance, where each new modal partially covers the previous one, creating a stack effect. This stacking can provide a visual cue to users about the depth of their interaction or the sequence of tasks. To maintain usability, these modals are designed with careful attention to transparency, size, and the ability to easily return to previous layers. They often incorporate animations for smooth transitions between layers and may include features like dimming the background to focus user attention on the active modal.Open modal

## Tailwind CSS Popover

Tailwind CSS Popovers offer dismissible, interactive elements with custom content. Create user-friendly interfaces with clickable areas and in-popover interactions.


---

#### Requires JS

Note that this component requires the use of the third-partyFloating UIplugin, else you can skip this message if you are already using Preline UI as a package.


---

### About


---

### When to use

Popover are typically dismissable, whether by click on other parts of the page or second clicking the popover target (depending on implementation), for that reason you can set up a popover to allow you to interact with other elements on the page while still being able to read it's content.

On top of that, since popover will remain open when mousing out of their target you can add additional buttons or interactions within them:


---

### Conclusion

If you want to add any additional content, interactions, or content more than about a line; or if you need the content to remain open without the target being mousedover use a popover.

Although it should be noted due to accessibility problems, potential SEO issues, and lack of discovery of the popover, it's not recommended unless you absolutely need it.


---

### Four directions

Four options are available: top, right, bottom, and left aligned.

### Обзор

Getting Started


---

## Preline JavaScript

This page explains how Preline JavaScript works, its methodology, and provides some examples.


---

#### Heads up!

For detailed documentation on plugins, please visit the plugins page.


---

### Helper for dynamic added components


                Preline JavaScript plugins include `autoInit` static method, it's useful when you need to reinitialize all elements on the page.


```
window.HSStaticMethods.autoInit();
```

This method can also be used with certain collections of initialized elements.

```
window.HSStaticMethods.autoInit(['carousel', 'dropdown']);
```

AJAX example:


---

### Usage of static methods inside TypeScript (TS) files

To use static methods inside TS files, it is necessary to declare the interface inside the files where method is called, this will prevent possible warnings and errors.

```javascript
...

                  import { IStaticMethods } from "preline/preline";
                  declare global {
                    interface Window {
                      HSStaticMethods: IStaticMethods;
                    }
                  }

                  ...

                  window.HSStaticMethods.autoInit();
```


---

### Prevent auto initialize


                To prevent an element from auto-initializing, you can add the `--prevent-on-load-init` CSS class.


This can be useful if you want to initialize elements using an event other than load.


---

## 💻 Примеры кода

```text
window.HSStaticMethods.autoInit();
```

### This method can also be used with certain collections of initialized elements.

```text
window.HSStaticMethods.autoInit(['carousel', 'dropdown']);
```

```javascript
...

                  import { IStaticMethods } from "preline/preline";
                  declare global {
                    interface Window {
                      HSStaticMethods: IStaticMethods;
                    }
                  }

                  ...

                  window.HSStaticMethods.autoInit();
```

### Gauge progress

To adjust the percentage, change the first number in the progress circle's `stroke-dasharray` where it's max value 75 for gauge and 50 for half circle gauge. For example, for 50% progress, use `stroke-dasharray`="37.5 100" (50% of 75 is 37.5).

## Tailwind CSS Range Slider

The Slider component, a type of range input, offers a consistent and customizable way for users to select values within a defined range. This intuitive component is ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or for applying filters in various applications.


---

#### Attention needed

By default Preline UI usesTailwind CSS Formsplugin. Don't forget to install it!


---

### Overview


                Create custom `<input type="range">`. The track (the background) and thumb (the value) of our Slider component are styled for a uniform appearance across browsers. Although Firefox uniquely offers a "fill" feature to visually indicate progress by filling the track from the left or right of the thumb, this specific attribute is not currently supported in our design.

### Disabled


                Add the `disabled` boolean attribute on an input to give it a grayed out appearance, remove pointer events, and prevent focusing.

### Min and Max


                Range inputs have implicit values for ``min`` and ``max``—`0` and 1`0``0`, respectively. You may specify new values for those using the ``min`` and ``max`` attributes.

### Steps


                By default, range inputs “snap” to integer values. To change this, you can specify a `step` value. In the example below, we double the number of `step`s by using `step`="1".

## Tailwind CSS Skeleton

Skeleton Tailwind CSS acts as a temporary placeholder for loading content. Enhances user experience by reducing perceived loading times in content-heavy pages.


---

### About

Placeholders can be used to enhance the experience of your application. They're built only with HTML and CSS, meaning you don't need any JavaScript to create them. You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility. Their appearance, color, and sizing can be easily customized with our utility classes.


---

### When to use:

- When a resource needs long time to load.
- When the component contains lots of information, such as List or Card.
- Only works when loading data for the first time.
- Could be replaced by Spin in any situation, but can provide a better user experience.


---

### Basic usage


---

### Example

Simplest Skeleton usage.

## Tailwind CSS Tabs

Tabs make it easy to switch between different views.


---

#### Requires JS

Note that this component requires the use of ourTabsplugin, else you can skip this message if you are already using Preline UI as a package.


---

### About

Use the tab JavaScript plugin - to extend our navigational tabs and pills to create tabbable panes of local content.

Dynamic tabbed interfaces, as described in the WAI ARIA Authoring Practices, require `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`, and additional `aria-` attributes in order to convey their structure, functionality and current state to users of assistive technologies (such as screen readers). As a best practice, we recommend using `<button>` elements for the tabs, as these are controls that trigger a dynamic change, rather than links that navigate to a new page or location.


---

### Tabs with underline

## Tailwind CSS Theme

Learn how to customize the default theme.


                The `@theme` directive of your `tailwind.css` file is where you define your project's color palette, type scale, fonts, breakpoints, border radius values, and more.


```
@theme {
                    --font-sans: "Graphik", sans-serif;
                    --font-serif: "Merriweather", serif;

                    --breakpoint-sm: 40rem;
                    --breakpoint-md: 48rem;
                    --breakpoint-lg: 64rem;

                    --radius-4xl: 2rem;
                  }
```


---

### Theme structure


                The `@theme` directive contains variables for `--breakpoint-*`, `--color-*`, and `--spacing-*`, as well as a key for each customizable core plugin.


See thetheme configuration referencefor a complete list of theme options.


---

### Breakpoints


                The `--breakpoint-*` variables allows you to customize the responsive breakpoints in your project.


```
--breakpoint-sm: 40rem;
                  --breakpoint-md: 48rem;
                  --breakpoint-lg: 64rem;
                  --breakpoint-xl: 80rem;
                  --breakpoint-2xl: 96rem;
```


---

### Colors


                The `--color-*` variables allows you to customize the global color palette for your project.


```
--color-black: #000;
                  --color-white: #fff;

                  --color-gray-50: oklch(0.985 0.002 247.839);
                  ...
                  --color-gray-950: oklch(0.13 0.028 261.692);
```


---

### Spacing


                The `--spacing-*` variables allows you to customize the global spacing and sizing scale for your project.


```
--spacing-px: 1px;
                  --spacing-0: 0;
                  ...
                  --spacing-96: 24rem;
```


---

### Customizing the theme

Out of the box, your project will automatically inherit the values from Preline UI and Tailwind CSS. If you would like to customize the default theme, you have a few different options depending on your goals.


---

### Extending


                If you'd like to preserve the default values for a theme option but also add new values, add your variables in the `@theme` directive of your configuration file.



                For example, if you wanted to add an extra breakpoint but preserve the existing ones, you could extend the `--breakpoint-*` variable:


```
--breakpoint-3xl: 100rem;
```


---

### Overriding


                To override a variable in the default theme, add your overrides directly under the `@theme` directive of your `tailwind.css`:


```
--opacity-0: 0;
                  --opacity-20: 0.2;
                  --opacity-40: 0.4;
                  --opacity-60: 0.6;
                  --opacity-80: 0.8;
                  --opacity-100: 1;
```

The officialTailwind CSS Themingdocumentation helps you to understand the full overview of the theming options.

## Tailwind CSS Tooltip

Use Tailwind CSS tooltips, floating non-actionable labels that explain interface elements or features, to improve user experience and navigation.


---

#### Requires JS

Note that this component requires the use of the third-partyFloating UIplugin, else you can skip this message if you are already using Preline UI as a package.


---

### About


---

### When to use

Tooltip are meant to be exactly that, a hint or tip on what a tool or other interaction does. They are meant to clarify or help you use the content that they hover over, not add additional content:

Since tooltip are only meant to tell the purpose of an element they should be short and to the point "Click X to do X" or "User post count"


---

### Interactions

Tooltip are typically only visible on hover, for that reason if you need to be able to read the content while interacting with other parts of the page then a tooltip will not work.


---

### Conclusion

If you want to give a small few word hint on how or what an element on the page does use a tooltip.

Although it should be noted due to accessibility problems, potential SEO issues, and lack of discovery of the tooltip, it's not recommended unless you absolutely need it.


---

### Basic usage


---

### Example

Hover over the buttons below to see the four tooltip directions: top, right, bottom, and left.

You can use the mark tag tohighlighttext.

This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.

This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.

This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.

This line of text will render as underlined.

This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.

This line rendered as bold text.

This line rendered as italicized text.

```javascript
<p class="dark:text-white">You can use the mark tag to <mark>highlight</mark> text.</p>
                  <p class="dark:text-white"><del>This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.</del></p>
                  <p class="dark:text-white"><s>This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.</s></p>
                  <p class="dark:text-white"><ins>This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.</ins></p>
                  <p class="dark:text-white"><u>This line of text will render as underlined.</u></p>
                  <p class="dark:text-white"><small>This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.</small></p>
                  <p class="dark:text-white"><strong>This line rendered as bold text.</strong></p>
                  <p class="dark:text-white"><em>This line rendered as italicized text.</em></p>
```

Beware that those tags should be used for semantic purpose:

- <mark>represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes.
- <small>represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text.
- <s>represents element that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate.
- <u>represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.

If you want to style your text, you should use the following classes instead:

- .markwill apply the same styles as<mark>.
- .smallwill apply the same styles as<small>.
- .text-decoration-underlinewill apply the same styles as<u>.
- .text-decoration-line-throughwill apply the same styles as<s>.


                While not shown above, feel free to use ``<b>`` and ``<i>`` in HTML5. ``<b>`` is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance, while ``<i>`` is mostly for voice, technical terms, etc.

### Font sizes

Utilitiesfor controlling the font size of an element.


---

### Gradient text


                Use `bg-clip-text`, `color-transparent` and `bg-gradient-*` classes to the text to add a gradient overlay to a text element.


This is a gradient text

```javascript
<p class="bg-clip-text bg-linear-to-tl from-blue-500 to-violet-500 text-transparent">
                    This is a gradient text
                  </p>
```


---

### Blockquote


---

#### Heads up

Check out the extended blockquote component styleshere.


---

### Lists


---

### Description list alignment


                Align terms and descriptions horizontally by using utility classes. For longer terms, you can optionally add a `.truncate` class to truncate the text with an ellipsis.


Description listsA description list is perfect for defining terms.TermDefinition for the term.And some more placeholder definition text.Another termThis definition is short, so no extra paragraphs or anything.Truncated term is truncatedThis can be useful when space is tight. Adds an ellipsis at the end.NestingNested definition listI heard you like definition lists. Let me put a definition list inside your definition list.

                  </dl>
```

### Responsive font size


                To style an element at a specific breakpoint, use responsive modifiers like `md` and `lg`.



                For example, this will render small `.text-sm` size on mobile, default `.text-base` size on medium-width screens, and large `.text-lg` on large-width screens:


```
<p class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                    ...
                  </p>
```

Check out theResponsive Designdocumentation for an in-depth look at how these features work.


---

### First-line and first-letter
